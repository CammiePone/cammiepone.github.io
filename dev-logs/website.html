				<b>04 Feb 2022</b>
				<hr><br>
				I had to present this website as a project for my Web Development Fundamentals class yesterday. It was very rough, as I tried to keep any CSS I used to a minimum, since the project itself was focused on the HTML structure of our sites.
				<br><br>
				If you need an idea of what my site looked like at the time, here it is in all its glory:
				<br><br>
				<img src="../images/dev-logs/website_1.webp" alt="White webpage with black box outlines containing images, and raw hyperlinks" width="100%">
				<br><br>
				As you can probably see, it doesn&apos;t look that great. Now, for the sake of having records, as it&apos;s possible it changes soon, I&apos;ve included what the site currently looks like:
				<br><br>
				<img src="../images/dev-logs/website_2.webp" alt="Magenta, grey, and dark grey webpage, with rounded boxes containing images" width="100%">
				<br><br>
				It looks so much better already. As of right now, I&apos;m using a flexbox for both the header and the footer, and I&apos;m using the colour scheme of my character: magenta, dark purple, light grey, and dark grey. I thought that would be kind of cute, since this is my personal website.
				<br><br>
				I also have it so that when you hover over any of the links on the site, it&apos;ll fade to the colour it should be when you hover over it, which looks a lot better, at least in my opinion, than just going straight to the colour.
				<br><br>
				Finally, there&apos;s one last little thing I left in the site: secrets! Or rather, a single secret. It's a &quot;super secret&quot; hidden credits page for all the images used on the site. I wish you good luck in finding it!
