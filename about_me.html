				<h1><u>About Me</u></h1>

				My name is Lily, though online I go by the alias Camellias, or more commonly, Cammie. I'm a transgender hobbiest programmer and game designer who taught herself Java through learning how to make Minecraft mods.
				<br><br>
				If you're curious about the mods I've made, you can go to the <a href="./projects.html">Projects page</a> to see most of them, but these are my <i>favourites</i> (in no particular order, of course):
				<ul>
					<li>Cammie's Combat Tweaks</li>
					<li>Icarus</li>
					<li>Arcanus</li>
					<li>Firework Frenzy</li>
					<li>Cammie's Wearable Backpacks</li>
					<li>Hookshot</li>
				</ul>

				Aside from making mods, I mentioned that I'm also a hobbiest game designer. I'm currently working on designing two VR games.
				<br><br>
				The first one is more or less an introductory crash course to making VR games. I've messed with creating VR demos before, but never a full game. With this, I wanted to make an arena game, of sorts, with the goal to completely remove controllers from the player, and instead use the player themselves as the controller.
				<br><br>
				The other game concept is meant to be a complete, story-driven RPG set in a fantasy world, as I feel there aren't enough games in fantastical settings being made. A bit of a jump in complexity from the first game, but assuming the first one does well enough, the revenue earned from it would go straight into the development of this game.
